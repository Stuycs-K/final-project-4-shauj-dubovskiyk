# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman(ECDH) Encryption
#### By Jefford Shau & Kosta Dubovskiy

What we've done in this project is create a high-level introduction to Elliptic Curve Encryption(ECC), the key exchange protocol from Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman(ECDH), and an overview of the mathematical foundations of this type of encryption. We've also sourced a succinct python tool for generating encryption key pairs.

Here's an overview of the inforamtion we've compiled in our PRESENTATION.md

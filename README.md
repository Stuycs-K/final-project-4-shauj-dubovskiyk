# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman(ECDH) Encryption
#### By Jefford Shau & Kosta Dubovskiy

What we've done in this project is create a high-level introduction to Elliptic Curve Encryption(ECC), the key exchange protocol from Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman(ECDH), and an overview of the mathematical foundations of this type of encryption. We've also sourced a succinct python tool for generating encryption key pairs.

Here's an overview of the inforamtion we've compiled in our PRESENTATION.md

## Introduction
 - Introduction to ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman cryptography) and its significance in modern cryptography
## Characteristics of Elliptic Curves
 - Explaining the mathematical foundations of ECC
 - Understanding elliptic curves and their properties
 - Dot Operations: point addition, point doubling, point multiplication
## Elliptic Curve Cryptography
 - Private and public keys, key generation
 - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
## Advantages of ECC Encryption
 - Compare ECC with RSA
 - Smaller Key Sizes: Exploring the benefits of ECC in terms of key length, storage, and computational efficiency
 - Resource Efficiency: Highlighting the lower computational and bandwidth requirements of ECC
## Real-World Applications of ECC
 - Secure Communication: Examining how ECC is used in secure communication protocols such as TLS/SSL and VPNs
 - Mobile and IoT Security: Discussing how ECC addresses the challenges of resource-constrained devices and ensures secure communication in the mobile and IoT landscape
 - Digital Signatures: Exploring the use of ECC for secure digital signatures, authentication, and non-repudiation
## Disadvantages of ECC Encryption
 - Vulnerabilities from Multiple Attacks
 - Legal risk
 - Backdoor speculation
## Homework
 - Homework for the audience: implement your own point addition/multiplication algorithm in Python, and test it.

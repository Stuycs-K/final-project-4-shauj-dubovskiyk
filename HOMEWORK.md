# HOMEWORK
Design and code your own functions that take in a curve, two points, and possibly a constant(only necessary info) and preform:
    a. Point addition
    (optional) b. Point multiplication

Then, with the curve: y² = x³ - 5x + 10 in ℝ and using your point addition code, find:

- With the point P at x=-2, which is above the x-axis(the y value is not neat...), and Q at x=1 also above the x-axis,
Find the coordinates of point addition on P and Q. P + Q = ( __ , __ )

- Similarly, with the same curve, and point P: x=-2.5 and a **negative** y value and point Q: x=5 and a **positive** y value, find P + Q = ( __ , __ )

Submit these two answers above as your homework.

Extra (optional) challenge:
Code a key exchange protocol, given the key generation code we have stored here.

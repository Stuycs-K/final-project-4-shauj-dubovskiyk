## GROUP MEMBER 2

### date 05/17/2023
Communicating w/ group, deciding presentation topic, initializing repo

### date 05/18/2023

Made lesson plan, put it in readme. 
Research - https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/, https://avinetworks.com/glossary/elliptic-curve-cryptography/, https://www.keyfactor.com/blog/elliptic-curve-cryptography-what-is-it-how-does-it-work/
Putting together presentation.md and made presentation format.

### date 05/19/2023

Research - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3zzNa42-tQ (really useful, point addition, point doubling, easy way to show why you always get a cascading chain not a bouncing back, adding vertical points -- P+Q=point at infinity, point multiplication Q=kP=P+P+...+P, need for a one way function -- finding k such that Q=kP is really hard), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvB-mhkT0w, 

### date 05/22/2023

Research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnpZXJL6QCQ, watched a lot of the lecture trying to understand mod p aspect. Considered switching topic, Hill Cipher etc.

### date 05/23/2023

Figured out how to implement simple decode encode.


### date 05/24/2023

Researching and understanding mod p aspect of ECC. https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.783/2015/Lecture1.pdf resource.

### date 05/25/2023

Worked on RSA assignment, spent in-class work time on understanding mod p still. Really complicated topic, includes finite fields and mapping.

### date 05/26/2023
Understood parameter G and parameter P, finally. https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modern-crypt/v/diffie-hellman-key-exchange-part-2 https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc

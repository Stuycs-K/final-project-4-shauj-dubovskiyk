Research - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3zzNa42-tQ (really useful, point addition, point doubling, easy way to show why you always get a cascading chain not a bouncing back, adding vertical points -- P+Q=point at infinity, point multiplication Q=kP=P+P+...+P, need for a one way function -- finding k such that Q=kP is really hard), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvB-mhkT0w,
